Build simple orgcharts using Make, pic, and m4.

To build the examples, type a command like the following:

   make -f ../Makefile mm.ps

The `pic' utility generates output consumable by Groff or LaTeX with the default Makefile using Groff to create Postscript files.

Multiple files can be concatenated together to build multiple charts in one file.
